# Title : Smart Lead Scoring: A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Customer Behavior

# Description :
Lead scoring is the process of ranking leads based on their likelihood to become a customer. It helps businesses to prioritize their leads and focus their resources on the most promising opportunities. In this project, we have used machine learning to develop a lead-scoring model that predicts the probability of a lead converting into a customer.
